# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction — Machine Learning Project 
📝 Problem Statement
Customer attrition (churn) occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. High churn directly impacts revenue, making it critical for telecom companies to identify customers at risk and proactively take retention actions.

In this project, we leverage data analytics and machine learning to build a predictive model using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. By analyzing customer demographics, service usage, and account details, we aim to classify customers who are likely to churn and provide insights for targeted retention strategies.

🎯 Objectives
🔹Analyze customer data to understand patterns contributing to churn.

🔹Build a predictive model to classify customers likely to churn.

🔹Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

🔹Generate actionable business insights to reduce churn rates.

🔧 Tech Stack
🔹Programming Language: Python

🔹Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy

🔹Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

🔹Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost

🔹Imbalance Handling: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

🔹Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV

🔄 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading & Initial Exploration
🔹Imported necessary libraries.

🔹Loaded and inspected the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
🔹Handled missing values.

🔹Removed outliers using the IQR method.

🔹Cleaned and transformed data for modeling.

🔹Applied One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables.

🔹Rearranged columns for better structure.

3️⃣ Feature Engineering & Scaling
🔹Scaled numerical features for better model performance using StandardScaler.

🔹Applied feature selection to retain important predictors.

4️⃣ Handling Imbalanced Data
🔹Target variable was highly imbalanced.

🔹Applied SMOTE technique to balance classes and avoid biased models.

5️⃣ Model Development & Comparison
🔹Trained multiple classification algorithms:

🔹Logistic Regression

🔹Decision Tree Classifier

🔹Random Forest Classifier

🔹XGBoost Classifier

🔹Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

🔹K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

🔹Evaluated models using F1-Score for balanced performance comparison.

6️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning
🔹Tuned Random Forest & XGBoost models using:

🔹GridSearchCV

🔹RandomizedSearchCV

7️⃣ Final Model Selection
🔹Random Forest Classifier delivered the best overall performance after tuning.

📊 Evaluation Metrics
🔹Accuracy

🔹Precision

🔹Recall

🔹F1-Score

🔹ROC-AUC Score

📈 Key Insights
🔹Key features influencing churn include: Contract Type, Tenure, Monthly Charges, Internet Service Type, and Payment Method.

🔹Imbalance handling with SMOTE significantly improved model generalization.

🔹Hyperparameter tuning helped boost model performance beyond default settings.

📌 Future Improvements
🔹Deploy model using Flask or FastAPI for real-time churn prediction.

🔹Implement feature importance visualizations.

🔹Explore cost-sensitive learning or advanced ensemble techniques.

🧠 Key Learnings
🔹Built a full end-to-end machine learning pipeline.

🔹Strengthened skills in data preprocessing, class imbalance handling, model comparison, and tuning.

🔹Gained business understanding of customer behavior analytics in the telecom industry.
